Reisender dotfiles
========

## install

- `git clone git://github.com/doweber/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
- `cd ~/.dotfiles`
- `rake install`

The install rake task will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your
home directory. Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`,
though.
